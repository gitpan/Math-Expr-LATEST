         Math::Expr

         Parses mathematical expressions into a tree structure. The expressions
         may contain integers, real numbers, alphanumeric variable names,
         alphanumeric function names and most other characters might be used
         as operators. The operators can consist of multiple characters.
         The only limitation is that a variable or function name may not start
         on a digit, and not all chars are accepted in operation names.

         See the pod documentation of Math::Expr and Math::Expr::Opp for more 
         info.
